Today we will complete an RNASeq analysis from counts to pathways.

We will work with data on differential analysis of lung fibroblasts in response to loss of the developmental transcription factor HOXA1.

## Data Import

```{r}
library(DESeq2)
```

```{r}
colData = read.csv("GSE37704_metadata.csv", row.names=1)
head(colData)
```

```{r}
countData = read.csv("GSE37704_featurecounts.csv", row.names=1)
head(countData)
```

> Q. Complete the code below to remove the troublesome first column from countData.

We need to remove the first "length" column from our `countData`.

```{r}
countData <- as.matrix(countData[,-1])
head(countData)
```
> Q. Complete the code below to filter countData to exclude genes (i.e. rows) where we have 0 read count across all samples (i.e. columns).

Let's remove all of those `0` values.

```{r}
countData = countData[rowSums(countData) > 0, ]
head(countData)
```

```{r}
#rowSums(countData)
```

## DESeq Setup

```{r}
#| message: false
library(DESeq2)
```


```{r}
dds = DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData=countData,
                             colData=colData,
                             design=~condition)
dds = DESeq(dds)
dds
```

> Q. Call the summary() function on your results to get a sense of how many genes are up or down-regulated at the default 0.1 p-value cutoff.


```{r}
res = results(dds, contrast=c("condition", "hoxa1_kd", "control_sirna"))
summary(res)
```

## Result Visualization

Now we will make a volcano plot, a commonly produced visualization from this type of data that we introduced last day. Basically it's a plot of log2 fold change vs -log adjusted p-value.


```{r}
plot( res$log2FoldChange, -log(res$padj) )
```

> Q. Improve this plot by completing the below code, which adds color and axis labels.

```{r}
# Make a color vector for all genes
mycols <- rep("gray", nrow(res) )

# Color red the genes with absolute fold change above 2
mycols[ abs(res$log2FoldChange) > 2 ] <- "red"

# Color blue those with adjusted p-value less than 0.01 and absolute fold change more than 2
inds <- (res$padj < 0.01) & (abs(res$log2FoldChange) > 2 )
mycols[ inds ] <- "blue"

plot( res$log2FoldChange, -log(res$padj), col=mycols, xlab="Log2(FoldChange)", ylab="-Log(P-value)" )
```

## Add Annotation

> Q. Use the mapIDs() function multiple times to add SYMBOL, ENTREZID and GENENAME annotation to our results by completing the code below.

```{r}
library("AnnotationDbi")
library("org.Hs.eg.db")

columns(org.Hs.eg.db)

res$symbol = mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                    keys=rownames(res), 
                    keytype="ENSEMBL",
                    column="SYMBOL",
                    multiVals="first")

res$entrez = mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                    keys=rownames(res),
                    keytype="ENSEMBL",
                    column="ENTREZID",
                    multiVals="first")

res$name =   mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                    keys=row.names(res),
                    keytype="ENSEMBL",
                    column="GENENAME",
                    multiVals="first")

head(res, 10)
```

> Q. Finally for this section let's reorder these results by adjusted p-value and save them to a CSV file in your current project directory.

```{r}
res = res[order(res$pvalue),]
write.csv(res, file="deseq_results.csv")
```

## Pathway Analysis

Here we are going to use the **gage** package for pathway analysis. Once we have a list of enriched pathways, we're going to use the pathview package to draw pathway diagrams, shading the molecules in the pathway by their degree of up/down-regulation.


```{r}
#| message: false
library(pathview)
```

```{r}
library(gage)
library(gageData)

data(kegg.sets.hs)
data(sigmet.idx.hs)

# Focus on signaling and metabolic pathways only
kegg.sets.hs = kegg.sets.hs[sigmet.idx.hs]

# Examine the first 3 pathways
head(kegg.sets.hs, 3)
```

```{r}
foldchanges = res$log2FoldChange
names(foldchanges) = res$entrez
head(foldchanges)
```

Now, let’s run the **gage** pathway analysis.

```{r}
keggres = gage(foldchanges, gsets=kegg.sets.hs)
attributes(keggres)
```

Lets look at the first few down (less) pathway results:

```{r}
head(keggres$less)
```

```{r}
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id="hsa04110")
```
![](hsa04110.pathview.png)

Note how many of the genes in this pathway are perturbed (i.e. colored) in our results.

Now, let's process our results a bit more to automagicaly pull out the top 5 upregulated pathways, then further process that just to get the pathway IDs needed by the pathview() function. We'll use these KEGG pathway IDs for pathview plotting below.


```{r}
keggrespathways <- rownames(keggres$greater)[1:5]

# Extract the 8 character long IDs part of each string
keggresids = substr(keggrespathways, start=1, stop=8)
keggresids
```

Finally, lets pass these IDs in keggresids to the pathview() function to draw plots for all the top 5 pathways.

```{r}
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id=keggresids, species="hsa")
```

![](hsa04640.pathview.png)

> Q.Can you do the same procedure as above to plot the pathview figures for the top 5 down-reguled pathways?

```{r}
keggrespathways <- rownames(keggres$less)[1:5]

keggresidslow = substr(keggrespathways, start=1, stop=8)
keggresidslow
```

```{r}
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id=keggresidslow, species="hsa")
```

![](hsa04110.pathview.png)

## Save Results

```{r}
write.csv(res, file = "my_results.csv")
```

## Gene Ontology (GO)

```{r}
data(go.sets.hs)
data(go.subs.hs)

# Focus on Biological Process subset of GO
gobpsets = go.sets.hs[go.subs.hs$BP]

gobpres = gage(foldchanges, gsets=gobpsets, same.dir=TRUE)

lapply(gobpres, head)
```

## Reactome Analysis

```{r}
sig_genes <- res[res$padj <= 0.05 & !is.na(res$padj), "symbol"]
print(paste("Total number of significant genes:", length(sig_genes)))
```

```{r}
write.table(sig_genes, file="significant_genes.txt", row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE)
```

> Q: What pathway has the most significant “Entities p-value”? Do the most significant pathways listed match your previous KEGG results? What factors could cause differences between the two methods?

The pathway for hsa04142 hase the lowest p-value so it is the most significant. The most significant pathways seem to do not match the KEGG results. This could be due to differences in methodology and criteria for data values.
